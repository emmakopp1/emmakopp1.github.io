Hi! I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Statistics in the CEREMADE at Paris-Dauphine University supervised by Robin Ryder. My research focuses on Bayesian computational statistics (mostly MCMC) and its applications to economics and historical linguistics.

## **About me**

My academic journey started in Paris doing a mathematic bachelor followed by a statistics and a computer science master. During my PhD I had the chance to work in London at Imperial with PhD director Robin and at the University of Edinburgh with Gr√©goire Clarte (working on Approximate Bayesan Computation methods). I am currently visiting Francesca Panero at Sapienza University of Rome to work on food security estimation with Sahoko Ishida, and Rebecca Leygonie.

After spending 25 years in Paris, traveling is real chance for me to meet discover new cultures and people. It allows me to discover new horizons, to open myself up, but also to understand what remains invariable for me. I get to know my interests better. On the personal side, I will never abandon movies and sports (even though the semi-marathon of Paris was one of my worst experiences). On the professional side, I love using data and computer science to help solving concrete problems. Projects that benefit society are particularly meaningful to me.
