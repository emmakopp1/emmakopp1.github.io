Hi! I'm a 3rd year PhD student in Statistics in the CEREMADE at Paris-Dauphine University supervised by Robin Ryder. My research focuses on Bayesian computational statistics (mostly MCMC) and its applications to economics and historical linguistics.

## **About me**

My academic journey started in Paris doing a mathematic bachelor followed by a statistics and a computer science master. During my PhD I had the chance to work in London at Imperial with PhD director Robin and at the University of Edinburgh with Gr√©goire Clarte (working on Approximate Bayesan Computation methods). I am currently visiting Francesca Panero at Sapienza University of Rome to work on food security estimation with Sahoko Ishida, and Rebecca Leygonie.

After spending 25 years in Paris, traveling is real chance for me. Traveling allows me to discover new cultures and professional environments, while identifying, by contrast, the elements essential to my personal balance. On the personal side, I stay deeply engaged with politics, current affairs, cinema, literature, and sports (even though the Paris half-marathon was one of my worst experiences). On the professional side, I'm driven by using data and computer science to address problems that make a real difference in society.
