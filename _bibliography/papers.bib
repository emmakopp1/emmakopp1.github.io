  abstract={The paper investigates the evolution of languages and weaving technologies among Kra-Dai peoples in southwest China and southeast Asia, using Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo methods to analyze phylogenies. Languages and looms evolved in related but different ways. Hlai speakers of Hainan are outgroups in both linguistic and loom phylogenies. Looms used by speakers of closely related languages tend to be similar.},
